## Lab05 - Exercise - Team (1 point)

By yourself, answer the following questions:

1. What do you expect will end up being the biggest challenges of working in a team by the end of the term?
    There are 5 members in our team, we split the work equally, and each member did works in time and in good quality so far.
    Now it's time for iteration 2, more functios and increased complexity, we need more commutication to keep track on otehrs work to better understanding what's going on for the whole project, but due to everyone study at home and meeting online, communication quality may reduced compare to meeting face in face.

2. Now that we're half way through, what is one aspect of teamwork that you're hoping to learn more about?
    I think one thing I'm hoping to learn more is that when everyone did a good job, we can share the happiness, and when some team mates did their work not really meet the spec, we can shae the failure. Not to blame others, and try to help each other to get better result.
