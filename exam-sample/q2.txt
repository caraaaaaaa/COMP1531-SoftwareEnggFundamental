Compare and contrast the differences between authentication and authorisation, providing an example for each.

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. Authorisation is the process of verifying an identity's access privileges.
Authentication is moreso concerned with determining and validating that someone is who they say they are. For example, checking someone's password or driver's license to confirm it's really them.
Authorisation is moreso concerned with checking what permissions an authenticated user has. For example, determining whether an authenticated user is a standard user or an admin user.
